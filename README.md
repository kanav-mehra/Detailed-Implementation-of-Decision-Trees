This repo contains the detailed implementation of decision trees for binary classification. 

* Dataset used is the popular Titanic Dataset
* Visualization of data (using Matplotlib)
* Simple logistic regression implementation using gradient ascent update rule (using Numpy)
* Visualization of Decision Boundary and Log Likelihood (using Matplotlib)
